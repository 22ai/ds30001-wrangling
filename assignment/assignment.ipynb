        "1. Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham outlines a framework for \"tidying\" messy datasets. She states that although the field has focused on the cleaning of data itself to get it ready for analysis, the field lacks knowledge about how the process of cleaning could be improved. In short, this paper contributes value to the field by creating a common framework for data cleaning that best lends itself to analysis.\n",
        "2. The tiny data standard provides a common framework to structure datasets to facilitate analysis. The standard is inteded to simplify the cleaning process across datasets by creating a common framework. The standard makes initial data exploration easier for a range of varying datasets, allowing for the creation of common data analysis tools that work on a range of tidy datasets.\n",
        "3. The first sentence means that without the tiny data standard, different datasets have unique characteristics and problems and therefore require dedicated analysis tools. On the other hand, tidy sets are alike enough that common tools can be appropriate. The second sentence means that for a given dataset, it's often intuitive to distinguish between observations (rows) and variables (columns); for example, a person is an observation, and their height is a variable. However, what a given variable might mean in the context of different datasets can vary greatly; for example, \"ID number\" could correspond to a variety of different variables\n",
        "4. Values are entires in the dataset, while variables are the different measured outcomes, and observations are individual cases/people that have different values for each variable. For example, a dataset of test scores would have an observation for each student, with each test score being a different variable, and with each student's score on an individual test being the value for that observation and variable.\n",
        "5. A tidy dataset conforms to the following three rules: a) each variable forms a column, b) each observation forms a row, and c) each type of observational unit forms a table (3rd normal form). With the school dataset, this means that each row represents a student, with each student having a score for each test, and each column representing one test.\n",
        "6. The five most common problems with messy data sets are: a) column headers are values, not variable names, b) multiple variables stored in one column, c) variables stored in both rows and columns, d) multiple \"units of observation\" in the same table (an observation means different things for different rows), and e) a single observational unit is used in multiple tables (they should be the same table). Table 4, an analysis of the relationship between income and religion, is messy because variables form both rows and columns, and values are used for column headers, instead of variable names. Melting a dataset means to stack it, or to turn each distinct variable into its own column. In this example, it would mean making an observation for each pair of variables (one observation = one religion and one income group, the variable is the frequency, and the value is the observed frequency)\n",
        "7. Table 11 is messy because it has variables spread across columns and rows--it has columns like id, year, and d1-d31, and rows like min and max temperature. Table 12(b) is tidy because columns year, month, and all the days have been melted to a \"date\" column, and it's further tidied by turning the row \"element\" into two distinct variables \"tmin\" and \"tmax\"\n",
        "8. Tools need tidy data to work effectively, but tidying data is difficult without effective tools. Wickham hopes that the tidy data framework can lay the foundation for future research in the field to develop better tools to streamline data wrangling. As it gets easier to tidy data, it will be easier to use tools."
